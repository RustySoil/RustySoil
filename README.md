- 👋 Hi, I’m @RustySoil
- 👀 I’m interested in conservation/sustainable farm operation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I am not comfortable with Win 11 and all the fancy stuff to do everything.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on measuring and managing microbes in the field, without a good market to sell my produce.
- 📫 How to reach me by landline 712-725-2487.
- 😄 Pronouns: he, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went to Iowa State University and earned BS in Ag Econ, MBA in Ag Business and MS in Agronomy, retired in 2018.
